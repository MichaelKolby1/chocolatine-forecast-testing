# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Fil Steps and Objectives
#   1) receive live measurements for many IODA series
#   2) keep per-series state in a ChocTimeSeries object
#   3) fetch enough history to bootstrap forecasting
#   4) load or request an ARMA/ZERO model
#   5) forecast the next window and compare observations to a lower threshold
#   6) report outage events when observations fall far enough below the
#      forecasted baseline
